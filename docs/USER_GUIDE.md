# Tackle Exchange User Guide

Welcome to Tackle Exchange—the safe, escrow-backed marketplace for used fishing tackle. This guide walks anglers through
the essential workflows for getting the most out of the platform, whether you are offloading last season's rods or
searching for a dream combo.

## 1. Create and verify your account

1. Sign up with email or social login.
2. Complete the profile wizard with display name, preferred fisheries, and communication preferences.
3. Upload identity documents and a quick workspace photo to join the Verified Seller program. Verification unlocks instant
   listing approvals and higher offer limits.

> **Tip:** You can pause verification and return later—your progress auto-saves in the dashboard.

## 2. List tackle with confidence

1. Navigate to **Sell → Create listing**.
2. Choose a category (rods, reels, lures, electronics, or bundles).
3. Follow the guided checklist to photograph the gear, note repairs, and tag compatible techniques.
4. Use the pricing assistant to compare recent sales by water type or region.
5. Publish immediately or schedule the listing to go live alongside major tournaments.

Listings instantly enter escrow eligibility, and buyers can make offers, ask questions, or request additional photos
through secure messaging.

## 3. Manage offers and orders

- Accept, counter, or decline offers directly from the listing card.
- When an order is confirmed, print the insured shipping label generated by Tackle Exchange.
- Pack rods in a rigid tube with foam inserts and include any promised extras.
- Drop the package with the carrier within 48 hours; tracking updates automatically appear in the buyer's dashboard.

## 4. Escrow and inspections

- Buyers authorize payment at checkout, but funds remain in escrow until they approve the inspection checklist.
- Both parties receive updates as the inspection window counts down (default: 48 hours after delivery scan).
- If buyers flag an issue, the dispute workflow pauses escrow while our gear specialists review evidence.

## 5. Get paid and track performance

- Once inspection clears, payouts move to **Wallet → Pending deposits**.
- Monitor fees, taxes, and buyer ratings from the seller dashboard.
- Download CSV exports for accounting or inventory planning.

## 6. Buyer essentials

- Use advanced search filters to match species, water type, and technique.
- Save favorite sellers and enable restock alerts.
- Start a secure message thread before checkout if you need extra measurements or close-up photos.

## 7. Support and safety

- Visit the in-product **Help Center** for quick guides on packaging, disputes, and compliance.
- Contact support via chat or email for real-time help from tackle specialists.
- Review marketplace policies at `/policies`—they outline acceptable listings, privacy expectations, and code of conduct.

Tackle Exchange thrives when the community trades with honesty, respect, and transparency. Tight lines!
