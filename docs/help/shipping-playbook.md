# Shipping Playbook

We provide category-specific packing tips with every label. Rods ship in
reinforced tubes with foam end caps while reels ship double boxed with molded
inserts. Lure assortments include tamper seals and humidity cards.

**Checklist**

- Print the carrier label from the seller dashboard.
- Photograph the packed order for AI provenance storage.
- Drop off within the handling window to maintain eligibility.

Escrow payouts unlock faster when tracking events progress without exceptions.
