# Dispute Center Runbook

When a buyer reports an issue we gather shipment telemetry, chat transcripts,
and AI inspection history. Support agents collaborate with compliance by adding
internal notes and assigning remediation tasks.

**Lifecycle**

1. Intake triage assigns the dispute to an on-call specialist.
2. Evidence collection pulls photos, sensor data, and policy acceptances.
3. Resolution outcome posts to both parties and updates the payout queue.

Escalated disputes automatically notify the admin duty roster.
